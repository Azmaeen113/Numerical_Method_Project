SIMPSON'S 3/8 RULE METHOD

Theory:
Simpson's 3/8 rule is a numerical method for approximating definite integrals. It's based on using cubic polynomials to approximate the function being integrated. The rule divides the integration interval into segments where n must be a multiple of 3.

Formula:
∫[a to b] f(x)dx ≈ (3h/8)[f(x₀) + 3f(x₁) + 3f(x₂) + 2f(x₃) + 3f(x₄) + 3f(x₅) + 2f(x₆) + ... + f(xₙ)]

where:
- h = (b - a) / n
- n must be a multiple of 3
- Coefficients pattern: 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, ..., 3, 3, 1

Algorithm:
1. Input the limits of integration (a, b) and number of intervals (n)
2. Calculate step size h = (b - a) / n
3. Initialize sum with f(a) + f(b)
4. For i = 1 to n-1:
   - Calculate x = a + i*h
   - If i is divisible by 3: add 2*f(x) to sum
   - Otherwise: add 3*f(x) to sum
5. Calculate result = (3*h/8) * sum
6. Output the result

Features:
- More accurate than trapezoidal rule for smooth functions
- Requires n to be a multiple of 3
- Uses cubic polynomial approximation
- Error is O(h⁴)
- Good for functions with continuous fourth derivatives

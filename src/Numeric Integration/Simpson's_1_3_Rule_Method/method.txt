SIMPSON'S 1/3 RULE METHOD

Theory:
Simpson's 1/3 rule is a numerical integration technique that uses quadratic polynomials to approximate the area under a curve. It provides better accuracy than the trapezoidal rule by fitting parabolas through consecutive sets of three points. The interval must be divided into an even number of subintervals.

Formula:
∫[a to b] f(x)dx ≈ (h/3)[f(x₀) + 4f(x₁) + 2f(x₂) + 4f(x₃) + 2f(x₄) + ... + 4f(xₙ₋₁) + f(xₙ)]

where:
- h = (b - a) / n
- n must be even
- Coefficients pattern: 1, 4, 2, 4, 2, ..., 4, 1

Algorithm:
1. Input the limits of integration (a, b) and number of intervals (n, must be even)
2. Calculate step size h = (b - a) / n
3. Initialize sum with f(a) + f(b)
4. For i = 1 to n-1:
   - Calculate x = a + i*h
   - If i is even: add 2*f(x) to sum
   - If i is odd: add 4*f(x) to sum
5. Calculate result = (h/3) * sum
6. Output the result

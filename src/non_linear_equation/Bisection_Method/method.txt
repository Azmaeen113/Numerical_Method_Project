BISECTION METHOD

Theory:
The bisection method is a root-finding algorithm that repeatedly bisects an interval and selects a subinterval where a root must lie. It's based on the Intermediate Value Theorem: if f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs, then f(x) = 0 has at least one root in [a, b].

Principle:
- If f(a) × f(b) < 0, then a root exists in [a, b]
- At each step, the interval is halved
- The method always converges for continuous functions

Algorithm:
1. Input polynomial degree and coefficients
2. Input initial point a, second point b, step size, tolerance, max iterations
3. Find bracketing interval [a, b] where f(a) × f(b) < 0:
   - Expand search left and right from point a
4. Bisection iteration:
   - Calculate midpoint: mid = (a + b) / 2
   - Calculate f(mid)
   - If |f(mid)| < tolerance or |b - a| < tolerance: root found
   - If f(a) × f(mid) < 0: set b = mid
   - Else: set a = mid, update f(a)
   - Repeat until convergence or max iterations
5. Output the root

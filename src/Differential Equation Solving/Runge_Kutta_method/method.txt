RUNGE-KUTTA 4TH ORDER METHOD (RK4)

Theory:
The Runge-Kutta method is a powerful numerical technique for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the form dy/dx = f(x,y). The 4th order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method is one of the most popular and accurate single-step methods for solving initial value problems.

Formula:
For dy/dx = f(x, y) with initial condition y(x₀) = y₀

k₁ = h·f(x, y)
k₂ = h·f(x + h/2, y + k₁/2)
k₃ = h·f(x + h/2, y + k₂/2)
k₄ = h·f(x + h, y + k₃)

yₙ₊₁ = yₙ + (k₁ + 2k₂ + 2k₃ + k₄)/6

where h is the step size.

Algorithm:
1. Input initial values: x₀, y₀, final value xₙ, and step size h
2. Set x = x₀ and y = y₀
3. While x < xₙ:
   a. Calculate k₁ = h·f(x, y)
   b. Calculate k₂ = h·f(x + h/2, y + k₁/2)
   c. Calculate k₃ = h·f(x + h/2, y + k₂/2)
   d. Calculate k₄ = h·f(x + h, y + k₃)
   e. Update y = y + (k₁ + 2k₂ + 2k₃ + k₄)/6
   f. Update x = x + h
   g. Output (x, y)
4. End

Features:

- Self-starting method (doesn't require previous points)
- More accurate than Euler's method
- Good balance between accuracy and computational cost
- Widely used in engineering and scientific applications
- Works well for smooth functions

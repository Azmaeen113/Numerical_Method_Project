DIVIDED DIFFERENCE INTERPOLATION METHOD (Newton's Divided Difference Formula)

Theory:
Divided difference interpolation, also known as Newton's divided difference method, is a polynomial interpolation technique that works with both equally and unequally spaced data points. It's more flexible than forward or backward difference methods and is widely used in numerical analysis.

Formula:
f(x) = f[x₀] + (x-x₀)f[x₀,x₁] + (x-x₀)(x-x₁)f[x₀,x₁,x₂] + ...

where f[x₀,x₁,...,xₖ] represents the kth order divided difference:
f[xᵢ] = f(xᵢ)
f[xᵢ,xᵢ₊₁] = (f[xᵢ₊₁] - f[xᵢ]) / (xᵢ₊₁ - xᵢ)
f[xᵢ,xᵢ₊₁,...,xᵢ₊ₖ] = (f[xᵢ₊₁,...,xᵢ₊ₖ] - f[xᵢ,...,xᵢ₊ₖ₋₁]) / (xᵢ₊ₖ - xᵢ)

Algorithm:
1. Input number of data points n
2. Input x and y values for all data points
3. Construct divided difference table:
   - For each order j from 1 to n-1:
     - For each row i from 0 to n-j-1:
       - Calculate DD[i][j] = (DD[i+1][j-1] - DD[i][j-1]) / (x[i+j] - x[i])
4. Display the divided difference table
5. Input the value xp for interpolation
6. Apply Newton's divided difference formula:
   - Start with result = y[0][0]
   - For each term, multiply by (xp - previous x values) and add DD coefficient
7. Output the interpolated value

Features:
- Works with both equally and unequally spaced data
- More flexible than forward/backward difference methods
- Constructs nth degree polynomial for n+1 data points
- Divided differences are symmetric
- Can be computed recursively
- Useful for arbitrary data spacing

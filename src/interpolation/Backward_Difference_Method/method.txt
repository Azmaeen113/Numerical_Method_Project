BACKWARD DIFFERENCE INTERPOLATION METHOD (Newton's Backward Formula)

Theory:
Backward difference interpolation is a method for estimating function values using Newton's backward difference formula. It is particularly useful when we need to interpolate near the end of a data set with equally spaced points. The method constructs a polynomial that passes through all given data points.

Formula:
f(x) = f(xₙ) + u∇f(xₙ) + u(u+1)/2!·∇²f(xₙ) + u(u+1)(u+2)/3!·∇³f(xₙ) + ...

where:
- u = (x - xₙ)/h
- h = spacing between consecutive x values
- ∇ represents the backward difference operator
- xₙ is the last point in the data set

Algorithm:
1. Input number of data points n
2. Input x and y values for all data points
3. Calculate step size h = x[1] - x[0]
4. Construct backward difference table:
   - For each order j from 1 to n-1:
     - For each row i from n-1 down to j:
       - Calculate ∇ʲy[i] = ∇ʲ⁻¹y[i] - ∇ʲ⁻¹y[i-1]
5. Display the backward difference table
6. Input the value xp for interpolation
7. Calculate u = (xp - x[n-1]) / h
8. Apply Newton's backward formula to compute result
9. Output the interpolated value

Features:
- Best suited for interpolation near the end of the table
- Requires equally spaced data points
- Constructs nth degree polynomial for n+1 data points
- Uses backward differences computed from the last point
- More accurate when interpolating near the end of data range

FORWARD DIFFERENCE INTERPOLATION METHOD (Newton's Forward Formula)

Theory:
Forward difference interpolation uses Newton's forward difference formula to estimate function values. This method is most effective when interpolating near the beginning of a data set with equally spaced points. It constructs a polynomial passing through all given data points using forward differences.

Formula:
f(x) = f(x₀) + uΔf(x₀) + u(u-1)/2!·Δ²f(x₀) + u(u-1)(u-2)/3!·Δ³f(x₀) + ...

where:
- u = (x - x₀)/h
- h = spacing between consecutive x values
- Δ represents the forward difference operator
- x₀ is the first point in the data set

Algorithm:
1. Input number of data points n
2. Input x and y values for all data points
3. Calculate step size h = x[1] - x[0]
4. Construct forward difference table:
   - For each order j from 1 to n-1:
     - For each row i from 0 to n-j-1:
       - Calculate Δʲy[i] = Δʲ⁻¹y[i+1] - Δʲ⁻¹y[i]
5. Display the forward difference table
6. Input the value xp for interpolation
7. Calculate u = (xp - x[0]) / h
8. Apply Newton's forward formula to compute result
9. Output the interpolated value

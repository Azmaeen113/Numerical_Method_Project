LU DECOMPOSITION METHOD (Doolittle's Method)

Theory:
LU decomposition factorizes a matrix A into the product of a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U, such that A = LU. This method is particularly efficient when solving multiple systems with the same coefficient matrix but different right-hand sides.

Decomposition:
A = L × U

where:
- L is lower triangular with 1's on diagonal (Doolittle's convention)
- U is upper triangular

Algorithm (Doolittle's Method):
1. Input the size n and matrix A
2. Initialize L and U as zero matrices
3. For i = 0 to n-1:
   a. Calculate U matrix (upper triangular):
      - For k = i to n-1:
        - U[i][k] = A[i][k] - Σ(L[i][j] * U[j][k]) for j=0 to i-1
   b. Calculate L matrix (lower triangular):
      - Set L[i][i] = 1 (diagonal elements)
      - For k = i+1 to n-1:
        - L[k][i] = (A[k][i] - Σ(L[k][j] * U[j][i]) for j=0 to i-1) / U[i][i]
4. Output matrices L and U

To solve Ax = b using LU:
1. Forward substitution: Solve Ly = b for y
2. Back substitution: Solve Ux = y for x

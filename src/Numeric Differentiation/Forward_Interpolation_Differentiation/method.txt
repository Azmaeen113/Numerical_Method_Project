NUMERICAL DIFFERENTIATION BY FORWARD INTERPOLATION METHOD

Theory:
This method uses Newton's forward difference formula to compute the derivative of a function at a given point. It's most effective when differentiating near the beginning of a tabulated data set. The method constructs a forward difference table and applies differentiation formulas derived from Newton's forward interpolation polynomial.

Formula:
For Newton's forward interpolation:
f'(x) ≈ (1/h)[Δy₀ + ((2u-1)/2)Δ²y₀ + ((3u²-6u+2)/6)Δ³y₀ + ...]

where:
- u = (x - x₀) / h
- h = step size (spacing between x values)
- Δʲy₀ = jth forward difference at the first point
- x₀ is the first tabulated point

Algorithm:
1. Input number of data points n
2. Input x and y values for all data points
3. Calculate step size h = x[1] - x[0]
4. Construct forward difference table:
   - For each order j from 1 to n-1:
     - For each row i from 0 to n-j-1:
       - Δʲy[i] = Δʲ⁻¹y[i+1] - Δʲ⁻¹y[i]
5. Input the point xp where derivative is needed
6. Calculate u = (xp - x[0]) / h
7. Apply forward differentiation formula:
   - f'(x) = (1/h)[Δy₀ + ((2u-1)/2)Δ²y₀ + ((3u²-6u+2)/6)Δ³y₀ + ...]
8. Output the derivative value
